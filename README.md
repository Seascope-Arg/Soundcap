Wireless Sensor Networks are known for the sensor nodes sensing the data and disseminate the data into its network. The disseminated data finally reach the sink node. The huge volume of data needs a real time handling at the station where Sink node is installed. This project shows the use of a middleware software required for handling and storing the data into a predefined format. This project also shows how to show the data in real-time using its presentation in form of instantaneous graphs. A warning system is also presented in the paper if the the value of data goes above or below threshold level.
